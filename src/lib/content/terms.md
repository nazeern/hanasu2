## Description of Service

### AI-Powered Language Learning

Hanasu provides an AI-powered conversational platform for language learning, utilizing artificial intelligence technology (including OpenAI's services) to generate interactive language practice conversations. The Service includes:

- AI-generated conversation partners for language practice
- Real-time voice and text-based conversations
- Progress tracking and learning analytics
- Practice reminders and scheduling features
- Vocabulary and grammar feedback

### Educational Purpose

The Service is designed for **educational purposes only**. While we strive to provide high-quality language learning experiences, the Service should be used as a supplemental learning tool and not as a replacement for:
- Formal language education or instruction
- Professional translation services
- Official language certification or testing
- Legal, medical, or professional language interpretation

## AI-Generated Content Disclaimer

### Nature of AI Content

**IMPORTANT**: The conversations, responses, and educational content generated by our Service are produced by artificial intelligence systems. You acknowledge and agree that:

1. **No Guarantee of Accuracy**: AI-generated content may contain errors, inaccuracies, or inappropriate responses. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of any AI-generated content.

2. **Not Professional Advice**: AI-generated content does not constitute professional language instruction, translation services, or advice. Do not rely solely on AI-generated content for important decisions.

3. **Educational Simulation**: The AI conversation partners simulate human conversation for educational purposes but are not human instructors or native speakers.

4. **Potential Biases**: AI systems may reflect biases present in their training data. We work to minimize such biases but cannot guarantee their complete absence.

5. **Unpredictable Outputs**: Despite our best efforts, AI systems may occasionally produce unexpected, nonsensical, or inappropriate content. We continuously monitor and improve our systems to minimize such occurrences.

6. **Not Certified Content**: AI-generated language lessons do not constitute certified educational content and should not be treated as equivalent to accredited language courses.

### Content Limitations

The AI-generated content:
- May not be culturally appropriate for all contexts
